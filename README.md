T.csv is cleaned version of data downloaded from NYISO, cleaning script at bottom of kalmanf_run

kalmanf.mat is the Kalman Filter algorithm
kalmanf_run.mat runs the Kalman Filter on T and produces a plot and correlations

In T.csv Column 1-6 is a date vector, Column 7 is Hour-Ahead data, Column 8 is Real-Time data
